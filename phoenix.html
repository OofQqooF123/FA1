		<h3>Phoenix's abilities are centered around fire. Being able to set himself on fire at will, Phoenix is also able to manipulate his flames to a degree to form 'constructs' which can affect the environment, such as walls or barriers of flame. It is unclear whether his 'flames' are actually fire (which would imply burning, and in turn, something that is being consumed as a fuel), or just a representation of incredible heat.</h3>
