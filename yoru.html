		<h3>Growing up in Tokyo, Japan, Yoru is the 15th Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL. He has Radiant powers that allow him to open small rifts in the fabric of reality, which he can then go through, or teleport through as he pleases. This has earned him the nickname 'riftwalker' by several Agents including Omen, Cypher, and Skye. The mask he wears helps him see while in said rifts.</h3>
