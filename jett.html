		<h3>Jett is of South Korean descent. She was the 10th Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL, and is among the youngest of its members. Jett is often regarded as having a 'toxic' attitude towards people. She prefers to do things her own way, without relying on a team, and is greatly confident in her own abilities. Jett's immense self-confidence can come across as arrogance, and feel as if she is disregarding her comrade's safety, however her voice lines indicate that she is opening up to those around her. They suggest that she does care for her friends, but doesn't know how to show it.</h3>
